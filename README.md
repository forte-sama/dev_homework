This project is my solution to a homework assignment

## Use as Chrome Extension

To use this app as a chrome extension, simply run `npm run build` and copy the `manifest.json` file located in the root of this project, to the `build` directory. After that, just need to load the app as an unpacked extension inside Chrome and voil√†!

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`
